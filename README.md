# Windows Service

Here is shown a part of a windows service project of a client.

This windows service is prepared to get the data from a SOAP web service, parse the data to a patterns of a string, store it to a database, and finally generate a CSV file saving in a specific folder, configured in App.Config file.

The ideia here is just to show my code style.

If you have questions, feel free to send a message.
